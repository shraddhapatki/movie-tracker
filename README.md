# Movie Watchlist

**What will my application do?**

Through my project, I want to create a movie watchlist that allows users to record information about films they
have watched, the genre, their ratings and their description of it. 

**Who will use it?**

This would a useful application for those who are interested in creating a list of the movies they want to watch and 
recording the ones they have watched. As someone who enjoys watching films, I think this would be an appropriate 
application to track this information.

**Why is this project of interest to me?**

I am interested in this project as I would personally use such an application for when I decide to watch a movie with
my friends and family. Or, I would use such an application to keep track of my favourite films and perhaps, use when I 
am in need of a film to watch.
